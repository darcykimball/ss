Compiling:

Use the Makefile and edit as needed; a (mostly) c++17 compliant compiler will work. The only other dependency is Boost.Filesystem, which is packaged with the typical libboost package.


Source code:

For the most part, documentation is inline and informal; some important notes are marked with 'XXX:'. Header files should contain function-grained documentation where necessary.

The full source repo should be at https://github.com/darcykimball/ss.


Test cases:

Screenshots are provided in screenshots/, and hopefully have self-explanatory names. The dummy resources are in the resources/ directory.

To test permissions errors, I did something like

# touch resources/cant_touch_this
# chmod -r resources/cant_touch_this

...as root. I can't upload such a file, since, well, I don't have the permissions either.

I also included a script, 'error_cases.sh', which demonstrates 2 dumb cases not covered by the screenshots.


MISC:

There's a lot of server-side debug output.

Logically http-pertaining stuff is under the namespace http.

I used the spawn-a-thread for each request approach.

Sorry for using C++.
